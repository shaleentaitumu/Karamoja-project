# Food-Security-in-Karamoja-uganda-


##  Project Overview
This project presents an **interactive Tableau dashboard** that monitors food security in **Karamoja, Uganda**. It combines **population data** and **agricultural yield data** to provide insights into food availability and demand across districts and sub-counties.  

---

##  Objectives
- Import and clean external datasets in Tableau.  
- Join **Population** and **Yield** data on District and Sub-county.  
- Build an **interactive dashboard** with maps, charts, and filters.  
- Highlight trends and challenges affecting food security in Karamoja.  

---

##  Data Sources
- **Population Dataset** – Sub-county and district-level population figures.  
- **Yield Dataset** – Agricultural production statistics by crop type.  

---

##  Methodology
1. Imported `.csv` datasets into Tableau.  
2. Cleaned and standardized fields (districts and sub-counties).  
3. Performed joins between **Population** and **Yield** datasets.  
4. Designed dashboard visuals: maps, bar charts, and trend lines.

## Dashboard Features
- **Map view** – Population and yields by district.  
- **Bar charts** – Crop yields by sub-county.  
- **Trend lines** – Yield changes over time.  
- **Interactive filters** – User-friendly exploration of data.  

---

##  Key Insights
- Population growth is uneven across Karamoja.  
- Some districts show declining yields in staple crops.  
- Areas with stable yields may indicate agricultural resilience.
